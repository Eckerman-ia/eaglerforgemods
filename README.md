    - By evokerking1
    - I have decided to not fix it.  All changes I have made still result in an error.
    - So officially from 3/14/24 and onwards it is at EOL or end of life, there will be no more updates, it will still be available, but I will not support it.  Feel free to try to       fix it yourself.   -evokerking
    - To heal you would need to type `p!heal` in chat or press h to heal.
